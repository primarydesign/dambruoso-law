    <h2 class="section__heading">Residential Real Estate Transactions</h2>
    <p class="service__paragraph">Massachusetts real estate law is a complex field, and negotiating and closing a transaction requires depth of knowledge as well as sharp attention to detail. Trust the real estate attorneys at D’Ambruoso Law to review your sales contracts, conduct thorough title examinations and arrange and attend your closing transaction anywhere in Massachusetts.</p>
    <p class="service__paragraph">Whether purchasing undeveloped land, a residential home or a downtown condo, an experienced real estate attorney can ensure that your title is clear, will provide you with a title insurance policy from a top tier national title insurance company, and give you much-needed peace of mind. Uncovering a problem at closing is far preferable to discovering an issue with the financing documents or title years later, when attempting to sell or refinance your home. A clear title is critical to protecting the legal and financial interests of mortgage lenders, banks, relocation companies and homebuyers. A title encumbrance can adversely impact a real estate conveyance, and can be caused by several factors. Our thorough title examinations will detect issues such as:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
       <li class="bulleted-list__item">Federal, state, county and city tax liens</li>
       <li class="bulleted-list__item">Mechanics' liens</li>
       <li class="bulleted-list__item">Missing heirs</li>
       <li class="bulleted-list__item">Missing parcels</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="service__paragraph">At D’Ambruoso Law, we understand the business and legal importance of ensuring that real estate is unencumbered and freely transferable. Closing the loan is often contingent on the ability of a real estate attorney to properly handle title examinations and effectively resolve title problems. Our low overhead and practical approach allows us to provide superior service at a fraction of the cost of larger firms. Once we’ve identified any title issues, we will work with you to resolve them.</p>

    <p class="service__paragraph">Further, our real estate attorneys will diligently and efficiently perform the following during a real estate sale/purchase negotiation and closing:</p>
   <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Prepare and register all of the necessary legal documentation
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Review the terms of your mortgage and confirm that the rates and fees are reasonable and fair, and match those that were quoted</li>
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Review title to make sure that there are no unexpected existing liens, mortgages, or restrictions on use of the property</li>
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Arrange title insurance to protect you from financial loss due to defects in title</li>
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Scrutinize every aspect of the sales agreement to ensure that its provisions are fair and, wherever possible, favorable to you</li>
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Help you read through and understand the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement, including how and when you will take title to and possession of the property</li>
      <li class="bulleted-list__item">Attend the closing and review all the documentation that you will be required to sign</li>
    </ul>
